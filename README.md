# discord-vc-levelup-bot
Python-based Discord bot that monitors and records the time users spend in voice chat channels. The bot keeps track of each user's total voice chat duration and assigns them a rank if they exceed a specified maximum time limit. It utilizes the discord.py library and stores the user records in an SQLite database.
